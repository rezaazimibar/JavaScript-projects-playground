# 🗺️ Mapty – Workout Tracker

Mapty is a simple web app that lets you **map your workouts** 🏃🚴.  
It uses the **Geolocation API** to detect your location and **Leaflet.js** to display an interactive map. You can log running and cycling workouts with details like distance, duration, pace/speed, and more.  
Workouts are stored in the browser’s **localStorage** so they persist across sessions.
