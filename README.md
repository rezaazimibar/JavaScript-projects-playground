# JavaScript Projects Playground

Welcome to **JavaScript Projects Playground** ðŸŽ‰  

This repository is a collection of **small, browser-based projects** built with **JavaScript**, along with **HTML** and **CSS** for structure and design.  
Each project is **self-contained** in its own folder and demonstrates a specific feature, concept, or interaction commonly used in front-end development.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen core **JavaScript skills**
- Practice **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**
- Build **hands-on projects** instead of only reading theory
- Provide a resource for **beginners** and learners who want practical examples

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each project is stored in a separate folder and usually contains:
- `index.html` â†’ the entry point of the project
- `style.css` â†’ styling and layout
- `script.js` â†’ JavaScript logic

You can open any project by simply launching `index.html` in your browser.
